# Data Mining Coursework â€“ MSc Data Science & AI

This repository showcases two coursework projects submitted for the *Data Mining for AI and Data Science* module at Queen Mary University of London. Each task focuses on applying data mining techniques to real-world data using Python, with an emphasis on outlier detection, document clustering, data extraction, and dimensionality reduction through practical coding.
